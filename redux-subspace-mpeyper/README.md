# Redux Subspace Example

Example using [redux-subspace](https://github.com/ioof-holdings/redux-subspace/), a library for creating isolated sub-apps with a global Redux store. It also has support for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), which was used to create this example.

To run the locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/slorber/scalable-frontend-with-elm-or-redux.git

cd scalable-frontend-with-elm-or-redux/redux-subspace-mpeyper
npm install
npm start
```
